This repository serves two purposes: Sharing lessons learned as a foreign entrepreneur in Norway according to Open Knowledge principles. Experimenting with creating a website, hosted on GitHub Pages, from .md files, a feature to be added to the Onyku\u00ae open-source project . Limitation: Due to the lack of defined Onyku\u00ae standards and templates for sharing such knowledge, the Onyku\u00ae proof of concept cannot yet be used to create and share knowledge in this format. Therefore, the prefix 'pre-' is used in the repository name. When such standards are defined, the content will be migrated to the new format in a new repository. Licensing I plan to make this repository open-source, but there is a licensing challenge. I will share my experience with my company, Calvet IT, so my own experience can't be modified but can be shared \"as is\". If it is modified, the company name must be removed. Therefore, I need to find a solution before modifying the licensing type. Contributing At this time, if you would like to contribute, for example by sharing your own lessons learned, the easiest way is to contact me with the contact form and optionally join the Onyku\u00ae community. I will then update the repository with your changes. Alternatively, if you are familir with GitHub, pull requests is an option. In the future, contributing to Open Knowledge via Onyku\u00ae will be done in two ways: * Improving an existing repository using Git pull requests: The application will abstract this part. * Creating your own repository with the same libraries and subject names: The application will have the capability to merge or view content from different repositories.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#pre-onyku-provider-entrepreneurship-in-norway","text":"Tips and lessons learned from Entrepreneurs in Norway.

I knew the company wouldn't generate revenue initially due to the development stage. I had savings to inject into the company to cover my salary. Mistake I initially paid myself a salary at 7.1 G to maximize pension benefits. However, employer and employee taxes significantly reduced my savings with each salary payment. Lesson learned Keep salary low until the company generates revenue. I quickly switched to a lower salary. This increases the time I can wait until the company generates revenues. A minimum salary is still needed: * Being an employee allows access to company insurance and reduces VAT compared to private insurance. * The salary must be higher than the monthly benefits like phone and travel insurance provided by the company. Drawbacks: Pension benefits and insurance claims are now based on a lower salary. Related If you have lost your job instead of quitting you should apply for dagpenger and apply to keep the benefits while establishing your own company. You will have to search for a job even if it is a waste of time during this process. You could then keep the benefits for 12 months while working for the company.
