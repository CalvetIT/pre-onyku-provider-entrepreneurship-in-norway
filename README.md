# pre Onyku provider Entrepreneurship in Norway
Tips and lessons learned from Entrepreneurs in Norway.

This website is created from a GitHub repository using MkDocs. It serves two purposes:

* Sharing lessons learned as a foreign entrepreneur in Norway according to Open Knowledge principles. More will be added in the future.
* Experimenting with creating a website, hosted on GitHub Pages, from .md files, a feature to be added to the [Onyku® open-source project](https://github.com/CalvetIT/onyku). 

This is not representative of the future Onyku® experience, hence the "pre-" in the repository name. 
The full experience will include:

* Standards/templates to support global collaboration according to Open Knowledge principles.
* An application designed to share or consume knowledge in these formats.
* The ability to merge information from multiple repositories.

When the standards are defined, the content of this repository will be migrated to a new repository, enabling collaboration.

If you are interested in shaping these standards, please join the Onyku® community on slack.
