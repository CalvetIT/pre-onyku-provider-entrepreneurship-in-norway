# pre Onyku provider Entrepreneurship in Norway
Tips and lessons learned from Entrepreneurs in Norway. 

This repository serves three purposes:

* Sharing lessons learned as a foreign entrepreneur in Norway according to Open Knowledge principles.
* Experimenting with creating a website, hosted on GitHub Pages, from .md files, a feature to be added to the [Onyku® open-source project](https://github.com/CalvetIT/onyku).
* Experimenting with adding this site as a subdirectory of the Onyku website.

Limitation: Due to the lack of defined Onyku® standards and templates for sharing such knowledge, the Onyku® proof of concept cannot yet be used to create and share knowledge in this format. Therefore, the prefix 'pre-' is used in the repository name. When such standards are defined, the content will be migrated to the new format in a new repository.

## Licensing
I plan to make this repository open-source, but there is a licensing challenge.  
I will share my experience with my company, Calvet IT, so my own experience can't be modified but can be shared "as is".  
If it is modified, the company name must be removed.  
Therefore, I need to find a solution before modifying the licensing type.  

## Contributing
At this time, if you would like to contribute, for example by sharing your own lessons learned, the easiest way is to contact me with the [contact form](https://calvetit.com/contact-us/) and optionally join the Onyku® community. I will then update the repository with your changes.  
Alternatively, if you are familir with GitHub, pull requests is an option.

In the future, contributing to Open Knowledge via Onyku® will be done in two ways:
* Improving an existing repository using Git pull requests: The application will abstract this part.
* Creating your own repository with the same libraries and subject names: The application will have the capability to merge or view content from different repositories.
